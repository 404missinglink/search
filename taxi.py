Driverless Taxi Simulation with 3D Visualization
--------------------------------------------------

This script simulates a driverless taxi navigating a grid with obstacles.
It first uses an A* search algorithm (implemented from scratch) to plan
a path to a passenger pick-up location and then to a drop-off location.
At the same time, a Tkinter window displays a 3D (perspective) view of the
grid, obstacles, the taxi (drawn as a small 3D box), and markers for the
pick-up (green) and drop-off (red) locations. The taxiâ€™s planned path is
drawn as a blue line.

No external libraries are used.

Reflection on the Implementation:
----------------------------------
1. Agent and Simulation:
   - The TaxiAgent class represents our driverless taxi.
   - The simulation computes two paths using an A* search: one to the 
     pick-up location and one to the drop-off location. The taxi moves 
     step-by-step along these paths.

2. Pure Search and 3D Visualization:
   - The A* search algorithm is implemented using only built-in data types.
   - For visualization, a simple perspective projection is implemented
     (using basic vector math) to render a 3D view in a Tkinter Canvas.
   - The grid is drawn in 3D (with obstacles filled in gray), the taxi is
     rendered as a small box with a bottom (yellow) and top (orange) face,
     and the planned path appears as a blue line.
     
3. Limitations and Extensions:
   - This is a basic simulation with hard-coded grid, obstacles, and positions.
   - The 3D projection is a simple model and does not handle hidden-surface
     removal or advanced lighting.
   - Future enhancements might include smoother animations, interactive
     controls, or dynamic obstacles.

This script uses no external libraries and is designed to run correctly on the
first try.
